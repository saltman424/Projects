# Breakout
This is a recreation of the classic Breakout arcade game. One interesting feature is the paddle is rounded and it is set up so that the ball will bounce off at a normalized vector, based off of where the ball hits the paddle. Additionally, the game features a help menu which displays the controls, and the game allows some cheat controls for the purpose of testing, e.g. skipping levels and controlling the speed at which the ball moves.
